              "description": "If you're wondering how to hit your irons pure, I have a simple drill for you.  Literally, within 10 minutes of doing this drill you'll be striking your irons more solidly and consistently than ever.\n\nPlease visit the link below and I will send you free samples from my Body Swing book and video series:  https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/\n\nSo many people struggle when hitting irons which is costing them a ton of shots.  This drill is not about hitting down on the ball.  It is not about forward shaft lean through impact.  It's not about changing your grip or anything else.   You may have tired those things in the past and they don't work because they have you hitting the ball with your arms.\n\nIf you want to hit your irons pure you need to stop doing all of those things.  This best drill for irons and it's totally different to anything you have ever tried in the past.  \n\nThe next time you're at the range give this a try.  I need you to tee up your ball.  Take out a mid iron and hit a whole bucket of balls doing this drill.   Then adjust as I explain in the tip as you get better at it.\n\nCorrection: 6:48\nHere I said squeeze against the ground.  Should be squeeze against the clubface.\n-------------------------------------------------\nMy Websites\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://ignitiongolf.com\nhttps://paulwilsongolf.com\nhttps://bodyswing.com \nhttps://swingmachinegolf.com \nhttp://howtohitdriver.com\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nMy App\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWork with me live from anywhere in the world through my new app called COACHLINK.\nAvailable for both Apple and Android devices.

That's where our Tour department, and people like @trottiegolf come in to play. Watch as Trottie describes in great detail how Rory's new driver is built from the ground up, including details on his his Fujikura Ventus shaft, the way he likes his grip built up to dialing in the precise swing weight Rory likes to feel. \n\nWith it's 60X Carbon Twist Face for more efficient energy transfer and faster ball speed, it's easy to see why Stealth Driver made it into Rory's bag to start the 2022 season.",

If they're happy with their first two drives, they can keep that number, OR, they can elect to hit a Money Ball, which wipes out their previous two drives and now counts double. \n\nFore more info on Stealth Driver, visit https://tmgolf.co/IGStealthFamily.",

              "description": "This is why you struggle to strike your irons pure and make solid contact 👇\n\n1. Your sternum is not positioned correctly at address\n2. Your forearms are not in line at set up - BIG ONE\n3. Your posture is misaligned at set up \n4. You turn in the golf swing as apposed to pivot\n5. You don't have control over the club face \n\nWhat's great is if you have any one of these faults in your golf swing they are really easy to fix and can make an instant impact on the quality of your ball striking not just with your irons but with your driver too.\n\nFor example if you want to hit your driver straight just getting the forearms aligned at address will be a real eye opener for you.\n\nPRACTICE PLAN\nHere's the practice plan and summary of this weeks lesson\n⛳️https://www.dannymaude.com/practice-plans-detail?productId=why-90percent-of-golfers-cant-strike-their-irons&widget=hidden\n#simplegolftips #subscribe #dannymaudegolf\n\nJoin his facebook Community here: https://www.facebook.com/dannymaudefan\n\nWATCH NEXT\n○ 3 Things that DESTROY your game (easy to fix) - https://youtu.be/dVBQJCo5qIc\n○ Easiest Way to Improve ANY Golf Swing - https://youtu.be/cf79tCny7sc\n○ The Perfect Takeaway Drill - https://youtu.be/iUSXTeTyCJA\n○ Why 90% of golfers don't hit driver straight  - https://youtu.be/miXs_Oj_BzM\n○ Simplest Short Game Technique - https://youtu.be/HxvAJNqdxOU\n\nCOME SAY HI!\n○ Website: https://dannymaude.com\n○ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dannymaude\n○ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/dannymaudefan\n○ Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/dannymaude\n#dannymaudegolf #golftips #golfswing\n\nBOOK A GOLF LESSON\n▶EMAIL: support@dannymaude.com\n▶ Visit My Website: https://dannymaude.com\n\nFREE TRAINING TO IMPROVE YOUR GAME\n▶Join my weekly newsletter -https://dannymaude.com/p/newsletter-sign-up\n▶ Join My YouTube Channel for Free - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTRAINING AID I RECOMMEND - THE ORANGE WHIP\n▶GOLFERS FROM THE US wanting to learn more about this weeks training aid just click the link below.  \nhttps://orangewhipgolf.com/discount/dannym?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fall-products\nIf you decide to purchase this will give you US $10 dollars off.  \n\n▶FOR ALL GOLFERS IN EUROPE - visit perfectmygolf.co.uk and use the discount code DANNY\n#golftips #driverswingtips #dannymaudegolf\n\n-----------------------\nABOUT DANNY\n-----------------------\nThanks for stopping by.  I created this website as a resource just for you to support you on your golfing journey as I know how tricky learning this game can be…to say the least!\n\nI personally found learning the game too long and difficult in the early days. I read all the books, watched all the videos but my game was not improving. Then after studying various forms of neuro science, motor learning, psychology and personal development in less than two years I went from struggling golfer to the final stage of the Open Championship.\n\nOn YouTube and my personal website (www.dannymaude.com) I will bring you the most up to date training, training that is getting tangible results for my clients right now.  I don’t know where you are in your golfing journey, you could be just starting out or maybe your body isn’t as flexible as it once was or you’ve got ambitions to slash your handicap.  Wherever you are I’ve created a place here you can learn, share your ideas, ask questions and get all the support you need to enjoy this great game.\n\nBe prepared though. If its a quick fix you are after Im not your man. Here I will give you step-by-step advice that you can take straight to the practice ground and apply to the course but it will require you to get stuck in, screw up…a lot, practice some more and then watch those scores tumble\n\nI’ve had the pleasure of coaching thousands of students all around the world and if you are up for the challenge and are ready to get in the game…LETS GO TO WORK!\n\n-----------------------\nSUBSCRIBE!!\n-----------------------\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThis golf lesson provides a couple of wonderful drills to help you hit your driver straight.If you are a beginner golfer and are looking for some golf driver tips that are simple and easy to do then you are going to love this.\n\nI will show you the golf swing slow motion so that you can see what you need to do to improve.\n\nWe look at 3 things:\n\n1. How to stop slicing your driver\n2. How to swing more in to out or how to swing more inside out\n3, How to get the correct impact position with driver\n\nand I hope to do all this with simple golf tips so you can create an effortless golf swing",
